From the router, add support for retrieving persisted operations from the Cosmo CDN when the client sends a request indicating a PO should be used.\r \r Persisted operations are for now scoped to the org/federated graph/client-id and can never be deleted.\r \r Additionally, persisted operation keys are always derived using the sha256 hash of the operation body. This allow us to use a content-addressable URL scheme that can be cached forever.\r \r Co-authored-by: JivusAyrus <suvijsurya76@gmail.com>\r Co-authored-by: Dustin Deus <deusdustin@gmail.com>"
